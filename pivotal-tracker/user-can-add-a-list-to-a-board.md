As a user
When I'm on the board view page

When I click on the "Add a List..." button
I should see the button turn into an input field with "Add a List..." placeholder text
And I fill the field with a new list's title
And I click on the "Save" button
The page should have an empty list with the title that I put in as the last list
And there should be an "Add a List" button after the last list on the page

Note: if the input is an empty string, the form doesn't disappear when we click the "Save" button.
